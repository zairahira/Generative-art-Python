$ pip install turtle
```
4. Run the code: `python3 eulers-theme`. 

## :traffic_light: Usage

1. Create a themed canvas as defined in `theme.py`.
2. Create curves using inputs provided to `euler_curve(step_size, angle_step, n_steps)`.
3. Curves are created with different set of values for experimentation.
